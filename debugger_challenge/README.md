# Debugger Challenge
  The app has a real and a fake debugger check API call.  Sysctl is the Apple recommended way to check whether a debugger is attached to the running process.    Refer to: https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/qa/qa1361/index.html  

Inside of this app, the fake sysctl function is called instead of the real sysctl function.

**Challenge:** with `lldb` alone, can you perform the same attack using a jailbroken iOS device with a app that was built in "Release" mode?  Release mode = no debug symbols, line numbers, file names, etc.  All have been stripped from the app.

### Setup lldb

##### Mac - setup port listeners
`iproxy 6666 6666`       (for lldb over USB access) 

`iproxy 2222 22`        (for SSH over USB access)
##### Mac - SSH onto jailbroken device
`ssh -p 2222 root@localhost` 

`ps -ax | grep -i my_app`  -> get your process ID 

`debugserver localhost:6666 -a my_app`
##### Mac - start lldb
`lldb` 

`process connect connect://localhost:6666` 

`(lldb) help methods.`  smoke test.
### Use case 1: Build app with in Debug mode
```
breakpoint set -p "return" -f hook_sysctl.c
breakpoint modify --auto-continue 1
breakpoint command add 1
  \> '' po fake_result
  \> '' script print "hello”
  \> '' DONE
continue
```
